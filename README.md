 # Prusa_Settings
My personal repo of settings and such for the Prusa 3D printer I have.
This repo will include INI files I use, as well as tools and files to help calibrate my machine, plus various STL files I use to upgrade my printer.
Most files are from the community and have been found elsewhere
If any modifications are required they are notated in the files of each one. The hot end temperatures may have to be adjusted to accommodate your setup. I have to bump temperatures by 5-15C from stock to compensate for my setup but other settings should still be perfectly fine even for a completely stock system.
Any files I have personally created are released under GPL v2

For the modified profiles it is based on my current modifications to the hotend:
1) 3D Passion Titanium Heat Break
2) E3D Nickel Plated Copper Heat Block
3) Midwest Tungsten Service v6 Nozzle
4) E3D High Precision 40 Watt Heater 
5) Boron Nitride Thermal Paste
6) Sunon Extruder Cooling fan
7) Moons Stepper motor for extruder
8) Nyloc Leveling Mod

I highly doubt I will do mods that take it too far from being stock.

Firmware merely updates the stock branch firmware to include the G81 Firmware tweaks for the Nyloc mod, you don't need to do it, but it helps with printing, just follow the guide here. https://github.com/PrusaOwners/prusaowners/wiki/Bed_Leveling_without_Wave_Springs
